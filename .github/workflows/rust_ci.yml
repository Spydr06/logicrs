# This CI (Continuous Integration) file will automatically check your Rust code for errors.
# It runs using GitHub Actions: https://docs.github.com/en/actions
# It will check the code compiles, run tests, run lints, and check for security issues.
# CI will help you standardise your code style and to detect issues with your code easily and early.
# It makes it easier to integrate different branches once they're finished.
# adapted from https://github.com/actions-rs/meta/blob/master/recipes/quickstart.md and https://gist.github.com/LukeMathWalker/5ae1107432ce283310c3e601fac915f3
